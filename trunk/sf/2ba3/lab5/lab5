CS2014 Lab 5 : Reverse Polish Notation Calculator

Thursday 19th November

The goal of this project is to develop a calculator for expressions
in reverse Polish notation. Your program should read in an expression
in reverse Polish notation and write out the value of that expression.

For example, if the input is:
	7 8 3 * 28 + +
The output should be:
	59

To split the line of text containing the expression into its component
tokens you should use the string tokeniser that you developed in lab3.

When writing your program, you should build a stack abstract data type
(ADT), which can store double precision floating point numbers. Your
stack ADT should provide functions to implement at least the following
operation: push, pop, isempty. You should then use this stack ADT to
evaulate the expressions.

Note that you must create and use a stack ADT in your program if you
want the marks for this lab.

The algorithm for computing the value of an expression in reverse
Polish notation is simple:

for each token in the input string {
  if ( token is a number ) {
    push token onto the stack
  }
  else if ( token is an operator ) {
    pop the top two items off the stack
    apply the operator to the two items
    push the result onto the stack
  }
}

At the end of this computation, if you are dealing with a correctly-
formed expression, there should be exactly one number on the stack.
This is the result of the expression.

This lab will be marked, and will count towards your end of year mark.
You should submit a printout of your project work to the Computer
Science front office by 4pm on Wednesday 25th November 2008. To be
marked, you must demonstrate and answer questions on your project at
your regular lab session on Thursday 26th November. You must
demonstrate the same code that you submit. All work should be your
own.
