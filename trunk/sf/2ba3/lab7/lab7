CS2014 Lab 7 : Spam detection

Thursday 3rd January 2009

One way of detecting spam email is to search the text of the email for
certain words. One problem with this approach is that spammers
sometimes rewrite words so that they are no longer correctly spelt,
but are still recognisable to readers. One way to do this is to
replace individual letters in the word with other characters. For
example, the letter 'S' might be replace by '5', the letter 'O' might
be replace by '0' or the leter 's' might be replaced by '$'. The goal
of this project is to write a program that matches strings even if
some of the characters have been mutated in ths way.

Write a C function that has the following prototype: 

int spam_search(char word[], int max_length, char text[], char *
		mutations[]) 

You should search for occurences of the string 'word'
(which should not be longer than 'max_length) in the string
'text'. The array of strings 'mutations' is an array containing 256
strings --- one string for each character in the character set. Each
of the strings in 'mutations' contains the list of characters that the
character with the corresonding ASCII code can be mutated to. So, for
example, mutations['S'] might contain the string "s$5". Write a small
C program to show your your function in action.

This lab will be marked, and will count towards your end of year
mark. You should submit a printout of your work for both labs to the
Computer Science front office by 4pm on Wednesday 10th December
2009. To be marked, you must demonstrate and answer questions on your
project at your regular lab session on Thursday 15th January. You must
demonstrate the same code that you submit. All work should be your
own.
