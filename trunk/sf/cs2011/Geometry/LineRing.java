/* A LinearRing is a LineString that is both closed and simple. 
   A LineString is a Curve with linear interpolation between points. Each consecutive pair of points defines a
   line segment.
   A Curve is a one-dimensional geometric object usually stored as a sequence of points, with the subtype of
   Curve specifying the form of the interpolation between points.    */
