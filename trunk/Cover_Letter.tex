Dear Sir/Madam
\end{flushleft}
I am writing in response to your advertised internship position between February 2012 to August 2012.

I am a fourth year student in Trinity College Dublin studying Computer Science, and expect to graduate from my undergraduate degree course in the summer of 2012 with a I.I. I then plan to go on a pursue a masters in computer science.\\
I am particularly interested in the advertised post because I would love to work in consulting. The idea of working with new clients and technologies on a regular basis is one that greatly appeals to be.\\
I feel I am suited to the position because I have very good teamwork, communication and presentation skills. I spent the previous summer working for IBM, which helped develop these skills greatly. In addition I have very good technical skills as outlined in my curriculum vitae. I am based in Dublin but moving around the country is not a problem for me.
\\*

I have enclosed my curriculum vitae. If you need any further information, please do not hesitate to contact me. I look forward to hearing from you.\\*
